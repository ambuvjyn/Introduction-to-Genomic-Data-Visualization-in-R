# Introduction to Genomic Data Visualization in R

---
## Course Purpose

## The purpose of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to the field of genomic data visualization using the R programming language.

---

## Genomics is a rapidly evolving and data-rich field, and the ability to effectively visualize and interpret genomic data is crucial for researchers and professionals working in genomics and bioinformatics.

## This course is designed to bridge the gap between genomics and data visualization, equipping students with the skills and knowledge necessary to extract meaningful insights from biological data through the creation and interpretation of various types of plots and graphs.
