          <h1>Course Purpose:</h1>
          <p>
            The purpose of this course is to provide students with a
            comprehensive introduction to the field of genomic data
            visualization using the R programming language. Genomics is a
            rapidly evolving and data-rich field, and the ability to
            effectively visualize and interpret genomic data is crucial for
            researchers and professionals working in genomics and
            bioinformatics. This course is designed to bridge the gap between
            genomics and data visualization, equipping students with the skills
            and knowledge necessary to extract meaningful insights from
            biological data through the creation and interpretation of various
            types of plots and graphs. By the end of this course, students will
            be able to:

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>R Programming Fundamentals:</strong> Students will
              develop a strong foundation in R programming, covering basic
              syntax, data structures, and manipulation techniques, enabling
              them to work with data efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Visualization Proficiency:</strong> Students will
              gain the skills to create and customize a wide range of data
              visualizations, including scatter plots, bar graphs, heat maps,
              and more, using the ggplot2 package in R.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Genomics Basics:</strong> Students will learn about
              fundamental concepts in genomics, understand the structure of
              genomic datasets, and explore biological data sources and
              formats.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multidimensional Scaling (MDS):</strong> Students will be
              proficient in the principles of MDS and its application in
              visualizing high-dimensional genomic data, allowing them to
              identify patterns and clusters within datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Volcano Plots and MA Plots:</strong> Students will be
              able to generate and interpret volcano plots and MA plots to
              identify differentially expressed genes, a critical task in
              genomics research.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis:</strong> Students will learn
              to prepare and visualize Gene Ontology data, gaining insights
              into gene functions and biological processes through bar graphs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heat Maps:</strong> Students will understand the concept
              of heat maps and how to create customized heat maps in R, making
              complex genomic data more accessible and interpretable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Critical Thinking in Genomics:</strong> Students will
              develop the ability to critically analyze and interpret genomic
              data through the visualizations they create, enabling them to
              draw meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Through case studies
              and a final project, students will apply their skills to real
              genomic datasets, gaining practical experience and building a
              portfolio of work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Collaboration and Communication:</strong> Students will
              have opportunities to work in groups on the final project,
              fostering collaboration and presentation skills as they
              communicate their findings to peers and instructors.
